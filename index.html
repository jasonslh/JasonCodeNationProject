        <h1>Welcome to my website.</h1>
        <h2 class="myname">Hi I'm Jason.</h2>
        <p id="aboutme">I'm a recent university graduate that studied Games Art, I became very familiar with softwares such as <b>3DS Max, 3D Coat, Mudbox, Maya</b> and <b>Sketchfab</b>. My interest for games art developed due my love for both video games and art, it only made sense for me to go onto to university and obtain a degree in games art. My preferred field is asset creation and environment design. I came to <b>Code Nation</b> to familiarize myself with the technical side of this industry, prior to this course I had no knowledge of coding and I felt that that having knowledge of the art and technical sides of the industry would make me much more appealing candidate for a job. So far my experience has been very challenging, the first week was no joke at the end of it I felt like I didn't understand anything. The start of the 2nd week I felt like I had begun to understand some of the basic principles of coding.</p>
