    <h1>Unit 1. Outcome .1.</h1>
        <h2>(1.1.1) Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</h2>
            <p>In modern business the radical progression of IT has affected modern businesses by being a more convenient method of conveying information. Such example could be the that costs of digital marketing is more efficient than the costs of newspaper, television, and radio advertising. Internet marketing creating advertisements on social media is are far more accurate way than traditional marketing to finding target audiences, discovering their needs. It’s difficult to see how many people read a newspaper ad. It’s easy to figure out how many people clicked on an online banner.<a href="https://www.business2community.com/tech-gadgets/importance-information-technology-business-today-01393380/" target="_blank">[1] </a></p>
        <h2>(1.1.2) Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
            <p>For digital projects, there are a wide variety of different resources and tools that could be used for completing digital projects. <b>HTML(HyperText Markup Language)</b> is perhaps the most basic building block software available for web design,<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/" target="_blank">[2]</a> in contrast <b>CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)</b> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css//" target="_blank">[3]</a> Whereas <b>VSC(Visual Studio Code)</b> is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com//" target="_blank">[4]</a> Trello is convenient for organizing a plan in the format of "Do, Doing & Done", the website is very easy to use and get to grips with, using this method and keeping up to date with it ensures that all tasks will be completed, Trello as a software benefits this method greatly with it's simple interface and accessibility.</p>

        <h2>(1.1.3) Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it?</h2>
            <p>I will plan this project by creating a <b>Trello</b> board, assigning steps in the overall progression to either "Do, Doing or Done". Assigning a deadline for each tasks would ensure I stay on track to completion for the final deadline for this project. Keeping on top of my <a href="https://trello.com/b/txIIxa05/" target="_blank"><b>Trello</b></a> board, ensuring I update it regularly to show what I have completed and what is yet to be completed will be crucial.<a href="https://www.interruptdelivers.com/themash/what-is-risk-in-a-digital-project-and-why-should-i-care/" target="_blank">[5]</a></p>

        <h2>(1.1.4) Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
            <p>When it comes to digital projects perhaps the biggest risk when undertaking a project is failing to plan correctly. Example could be that if an update for an operating system becomes available, your work could not be optimized appropriately for the new update. A different change in ideology or leadership that has a different go-to-market strategy which may result in a completely overhaul of the design process. Team member's that potentially don't turn up for these projects could also potentially cause to major problems which could in turn make the whole project take on a new path which would take the expected completion date beyond a deadline. Preparing to have a back-up plan in case a problem does occur will help to mitigate any risks and won't make previous work all for naught.<a href="https://www.interruptdelivers.com/themash/what-is-risk-in-a-digital-project-and-why-should-i-care/" target="_blank">[6]</a></p>

        <h2>(1.1.5) Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
            <p>Primarily I'll be using <b>Windows</b> as I find the operating system much more familiar than Mac. Depending at which stage I'm at will determine which technology I'd be using, example in the earlier stages during the planning phase I'd use <b>Trello</b> to map out what needs to be completed and when. I'd also research which software are available for me to use depending on what I need to do and go off what's the best for beginners. The most ideal piece of software to use for coding would be <b>VSC</b> and either using the <b>Python</b> or <b>HTML</b> language. Python for coding programs and text base games. HTML for coding websites. To develop said websites CSS would be the most favourable for web development. In contrast if we were to explore software that would be beneficial for video games, <b>C++</b> and <b>Java Script</b> would have to be the go to languages.</p>

        <h2>(1.1.6) Provide analysis on how my chosen technologies have helped achieve outcomes. How has Trello helped me plan and how can Git and GitHub help with codes version control.</h2>
            <p> VSC (HTML & CSS) has been essential to achieve an outcome that could be suitable to go up onto the internet. HTML provides many methods for web development. Including classes and divisions enabled me to craft the website much more strategically as opposed to not including these. They enable me to highlight specific features and manipulate them specifically into any way that I saw fit when stylising them in CSS. I have also been able to include links that are attached to images, keywords and numbers that take the user onto a separate tab so they can explore further. Trello's simple interface helped me put together a very simple plan as to what I have to do and enables me to easily add to it and keep on top if it. Git and GitHub gives me control over uploading code and regularly updating code. When I upload a new version, Git checks to see if there are any changes and adjusts the current file to compensate, there won't be any duplicate files when uploading a new version. For future projects, Trello would be used for planning and Git would be used for uploading code.</p>
        <h2>(1.1.7) Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
            <p><b>GDPR</b> stands for <b>Data Protection Regulation</b> and is designed to protect your personal information. GDPR is the law that governs your personal data; every company in the UK needs to abide by it and let you know how your personal data is used.<a href="https://www.nrshealthcare.co.uk/gdpr?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxsSQofDO5wIViKztCh3OugVjEAAYASAAEgKCC_D_BwE/" target="_blank">[7]</a> The website is being tracked by Google Analytics and you may also be using other Social Media services which are all termed as third-party services.
