<h2>(2.5) Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>
    <p><b>Copyright</b> is a form of protection provided to the original authors of works including literary, artistic and other intellectual works. These constraints on people's work protect them from others potentially copying or stealing their work. A method to be able to use the work on the copyrighted website is the reference that website and ensure that you give the website full credit for anything that you use from there. The layout, style and feel of the website cannot be copyrighted. Common, unoriginal material such as names, icons or familiar symbols are not subject to copyright.<a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/copyright-a-website-to-protect-it-4145788/" target="_blank">[9]</a></p>

<h2>(2.6) Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
    <p>Websites that include small or low contrast fonts can be hard to read for people with visual impairments but also for people with tired eyes. Hard to read messages and design layouts that are overly complex may have a negative impact on people with dyslexia and cognitive impairments. Resolving these issues would simply be the case of careful planning and smart placements of information with colour contrasts that are easy on the eyes.<a href="https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/interactive-design/how-design-websites-for-disabled-people-in-2017//" target="_blank">[10]</a></p>
<h2>(2.7) Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</h2>
    <p>There are numerous file-types that are used for websites, however there are some which are much more common than others. ".CSS" files are a tool that enable the creator of the website to design their website however way they want. ".DOC" is Microsoft Word, the most popular word processing software, however without having the appropriate software it may be a struggle to successfully open the document. ".GIF" is perhaps the most common image file found on the internet, they're used for simple image animations. ".HTML" websites will mostly consist of files from this file-type. ".JPG" is another image format that is very common to find on websites, primarily for photo's. ".MP3" is a sound file format that is highly compressed, and is easily downloaded that can still result in a high quality sound file.<a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html/" target="_blank">[11]</a></p>
