    <h1> Unit.1 Outcome .2.</h1>
        <h2> (1.2.1) Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed - in making your own website.</h2>
            <p>The tools that we have used for this project, being Visual Studio Code, Trello and Slack have proven to be very useful and appropriate for me to be able to get to grips with this project. Trello has been key for me to successfully organise what I have needed to do, what is being done and what is done.  The ease of use has been a great help. Visual Studio Code has been superb in helping me achieve my outcome with being able to use languages such as HTML and CSS, the languages themselves I have found to be much easier to get to grips with in contrast to Python. As someone who is much more into the visual and artistic side of things, seeing my code translate to a website live with colours, imagery and structure was much more appealing to me.</p>
        <h2> (1.2.2) Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate.</h2>
            <p> The tools that we have used for this project, being Visual Studio Code, Trello and Slack have proven to be very useful and appropriate for me to be able to get to grips with this project. The tools were very efficient and simple enough to get to grips with to create the desired effect that I ultimately achieved on my website. The support that VSC offers for HTML and CSS has proven to be key in developing my website HTML was simple enough to understand the basic fundamentals and what codes I need to type in to achieve a certain description and CSS was equally as simple for a beginner to get to grips with in stylising the overall aesthetic of the website. </p>
        <h2> (1.2.3) Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project - are you happy with your website?</h2>
            <p>  The key strengths of this project is the colour scheme and how visually eye catching it is, the simplicity of the overall structure is something that I always have preferred in website design, an overly complex interface is a no go, I opted for ease of use and accessibility when it came to designing the structure of the website. However the simple structure of it may be too simple and not be as unique as I originally envisioned my website to be at the start of the project. I also think that the quality of responses to some questions is variable, I feel that some questions I gave a decent structured answers with variety in language, others not so much. I believe that it is due to my uncertainty of what some questions were asking or if the questions themselves were too broad. Although I like the overall colour scheme and what's going on, I think that the background itself is perhaps too distracting, I want the main focus of the website to be the questions and responses, perhaps adjusting the opacity of the background or have static images may be the key solution here. Despite this, I adjusted the background of each question and answer so that is has a subtle transparency, you can still see the background running behind the text and the text itself is still visible enough to read. Experimentation with the design and layout to promote and more unique website is something I'd like to have a go at changing if given more time and finally I'd attempt to go more in depth with some of my answers.</p>

        <h2> (1.2.4) Describe further improvement you can make to your project.</h2>
            <p> I think for further improvements to my website I could include the flex function in CSS to all my of my questions, answers and navigation bar at the top to demonstrate more technical knowledge on my website it would also make the website easier to navigate depending on the size of the internet tab that the user has open and scale of their monitor. Also more frequent use of Trello with more care to the style and visibility of my Trello board to make it much more interesting visually.</p>

        <h2> (1.2.5) Review the outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</h2>
            <p> In HTML we are able to use specific lines of code (a href =" " target=blank) that grants us the ability to assign a hyperlink to words or even images, following that hyperlink opens that link into a new tab rather than over the current page. Doing this advocates accessibility and ease of use on my website. Adding onto the idea of ease of use and accessibility instead of having all the information on one page, we can create a navigation bar using the same basic principles as hyperlinks, however we need to add the content on other pages into a new HTML file and incorporating the same code under "Head" in our "index.html" file. We can also create a "Class" for this navigation bar to make each one specific and give them their own characteristics if necessary. Finally I've tested every each link associated with words, images and pages and they all go to exactly where I want them to go to.</p>
