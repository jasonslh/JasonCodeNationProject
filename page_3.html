        <h2>(1.3.1) Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h2>
            <p> The benefits of IT tools and Systems are many in terms of productivity and efficiency. For me seeing a visual output of the code that I have created on VSC acted as an incentive for me to strive to keep developing the code to make my website more flashy, unique and personal to myself. However being in a team and lessening to load of work it may have perhaps resulted in more impressive concise pieces of work per individual that worked on the project. There would have been room for more professional elements to be included in the website. Some drawbacks of IT tools and Systems will always come down to what if for whatever reason the piece of software just doesn't work on that particular day? There is also the reason that we are developing our skills using VSC and such development would take time, and does ultimately slow the rate at which we are putting our websites together; as we are having to regularly check and experiment with new methods for constructing our websites.</p>
        <h2>(1.3.2) Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.</h2>
            <p> There are many methods that can improve productivity and efficiency, some key methods could have been implemented within my project; such as: Knowing my strengths and weaknesses. My key strengths is my knowledge of art and how to make something look visually appealing, I think that if for example we did this project in groups, it could have perhaps been a good idea to assign different elements of the project to different members, I am comfortable with art and stylising work. The CSS side to this project I enjoyed greatly as I was able to include some of my own experience in other subjects. Constantly keeping up to date with responsibilities and ensuring that tasks are completed at a reasonable rate would be another major way to improve productivity and efficiency, essentially making sure that you are keeping yourself or others busy. Having incentives for doing something is for me personally a sure-fire way of ensuring that something get's done and done well. <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2017/02/improve-team-efficiency-productivity.html" target="_blank">[9]</a></p>
        <h2>(1.3.3) Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects.</h2>
            <p> I think to improve my own productivity I need to not be as cautious about making mistakes and just to try things and see if they work out. Also to ask for help more frequently would help me get on the right track to doing more things and developing my projects further at a faster rate. I think team-work personally for me would decrease my productivity as I have always preferred and have worked much better doing things by myself, I have complete control over decisions and where projects go. Slack has been useful to the extent where I have been able to look at other people's code and figure out what separates mine from theirs and to even include that code within my work and figure out if something works or doesn't.</p>
        <h2>(1.3.4) Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions.</h2>
            <p> Whenever I make changes to my existing code, such as adding in new information, hyperlinks and images, I'll re-open my index.HTML file to visually see if the information that I have added has successfully transferred over. Git and GitHub is another method where I can upload all my code and images associated with my website, through that I can clearly see whether something has worked or it hasn't. Having someone else test and experiment with my code may yield much different results than myself testing it as I am familiar with my own style of coding. Example being in our Python project, we had others test our outcomes and they picked up on a few inconsistencies with the code and structure which I hadn't noticed prior.</p>
