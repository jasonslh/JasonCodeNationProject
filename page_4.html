        <h2>(2.1.1) Describing the content and layout for each page.</h2>
            <p>As I am learning the basic principles of HTML and CSS, I opted for a very simple yet colourful approach to the aesthetic of my website. Each page on this website refers to each Unit and Outcome E.g. Page 1 = Unit 1, Outcome  and all the questions and answers are on said page. I felt that this structure made the most sense in readability and accessibility. As my key interests align with the Games Industry I wanted to advocate the sense of a video game based website with the use of pixel game artwork for the background of each page and colourful text to compliment this design choice. I used imagery that related to each question so the reader had a clearer sense of what I was talking about in each question.</p>
        <h2>(2.1.5) Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites.</h2>
            <p><b>Copyright</b> is a form of protection provided to the original authors of works including literary, artistic and other intellectual works. These constraints on people's work protect them from others potentially copying or stealing their work. A method to be able to use the work on the copyrighted website is the reference that website and ensure that you give the website full credit for anything that you use from there. The layout, style and feel of the website cannot be copyrighted. Common, unoriginal material such as names, icons or familiar symbols are not subject to copyright.<a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/copyright-a-website-to-protect-it-4145788/" target="_blank">[9]</a> To combat against copyright I have ensured that information and resources that have been included have been referenced correctly with a tag that when clicked takes you to the website which the information was gathered from. With imagery I've specifically been searching for those that don't include any watermarks and checked the associated websites to check if there is anything about copyright. Additionally as this work is used for educational and research purposes this would fall under fair use.<a href="https://www.bl.uk/business-and-ip-centre/articles/how-to-avoid-copyright-infringement/" target="_blank">[10]</a></p>

        <h2>(2.1.6) Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
            <p>Websites that include small or low contrast fonts can be hard to read for people with visual impairments but also for people with tired eyes. Hard to read messages and design layouts that are overly complex may have a negative impact on people with dyslexia and cognitive impairments. Resolving these issues would simply be the case of careful planning and smart placements of information with colour contrasts that are easy on the eyes. <a href="https://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/interactive-design/how-design-websites-for-disabled-people-in-2017//" target="_blank">[11]</a> I have attempted to follow these principles in web design by ensuring that the text and font is simple, easy to read and has a good contrast with it's background, maintaining a very simplistic design layout making it easy to navigate (navigation bar at the top for each page and the user only having to scroll up/down).</p>
        <h2>(2.1.7) Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites.</h2>
            <p>There are numerous file-types that are used for websites, however there are some which are much more common than others. ".CSS" files are a tool that enable the creator of the website to design their website however way they want. ".DOC" is Microsoft Word, the most popular word processing software, however without having the appropriate software it may be a struggle to successfully open the document. ".GIF" is perhaps the most common image file found on the internet, they're used for simple image animations. ".HTML" websites will mostly consist of files from this file-type. ".JPG" is another image format that is very common to find on websites, primarily for photo's. ".MP3" is a sound file format that is highly compressed, and is easily downloaded that can still result in a high quality sound file.<a href="https://www.yourhtmlsource.com/starthere/fileformats.html/" target="_blank">[12]</a></p>
